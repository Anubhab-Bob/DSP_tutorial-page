                <hr>
                <br>
                <p>
                    We have covered Arrays in our previous week as part of this course. In this week we shall try to
                    understand a few limitations of Arrays and how they can be overcome using another data structure
                    called linked list.<br>
                    A linked list is a sequence of data structures, which are connected together via links. Linked List
                    is a sequence of links which contains items. Each link contains a connection to another link. Linked
                    list is the second most-used data structure after array. The size of the linked list is not fixed,
                    and data items can be added at any locations in the list. The disadvantage is that to get to a node,
                    we must traverse to all the way from the first node to the node that we require. The Linked List is
                    like an array but unlike an array, it is not stored sequentially in the memory.<br>
                    A linked list is a linear data structure that includes a series of connected nodes. Here, each node
                    stores the data and the address of the next node. You have to start somewhere, so we give the
                    address of the first node a special name called HEAD. Also, the last node in the linked list can be
                    identified because its next portion points to NULL as shown below.<br>

                <h4>Properties of Linked Lists</h4><br>
                <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>1. The list is not required to be contiguously present in the memory. The node can reside any
                        where in the memory and linked together to make a list. This achieves optimized utilization of
                        space.</li>
                    <li>2. List size is limited to the memory size and doesn't need to be declared in advance.</li>
                    <li>3. Empty node can not be present in the linked list.</li>
                    <li>4. We can store values of primitive types or objects in the singly linked list.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Representation, Declaration and Initialization of Linked Lists</h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Let's see how each node of the linked list is represented. Each node consists: a data item and an
                    address of another node. We wrap both the data item and the next node reference in a struct as:
                <div class="code">
                    struct node { <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int data; <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;struct node *next; <br>
                    };<br>
                </div>
                To declare a linked list in C, a programmer specifies the data type of the node, i.e., struct node
                followed by a pointer name as follows -
                <div class="code">struct node *pointerName;</div>
                For example, to declare 2 linked list pointers having nodes of the type given previously, use this
                statement âˆ’
                <div class="code">struct node *head, *ptr;</div>
                Since these lists are handled with pointers, only declaration do not suffice. Memory also has to be
                allocated dynamically for each node like this - <br>
                <div class="code">ptr = (struct node *)malloc(sizeof(struct node *));</div>
                The malloc () is used for dynamic memory allocation and is present in the stdlib header file in C. So
                make sure you include stdlib header file whenever you are writing a program on linked lists.
                The following code is an example code showing declaration and initialisation of linked lists -
                <div class="code">
                    #include <stdio.h> <br>
                        #include <stdlib.h><br>
                            struct person {<br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int age;<br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;float weight;<br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;char name[30];<br>
                            };<br>

                            int main() {<br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;struct person *ptr;<br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int i, n;<br>

                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;printf("Enter the number of persons: ");<br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scanf("%d", &n);<br>

                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// allocating memory for n numbers of struct person<br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ptr = (struct person*) malloc(n * sizeof(struct person));<br>

                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for(i = 0; i < n; ++i) { <br>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;printf("Enter first name and age
                                respectively: "); <br>

                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// To access members of 1st struct
                                person,<br>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// ptr->name and ptr->age is used<br>

                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// To access members of 2nd struct
                                person,<br>

                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scanf(" %s %d", (ptr+i)->name,
                                &(ptr+i)->age);<br>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>

                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;printf("Displaying Information:\n");<br>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for(i = 0; i < n; ++i) <br>
                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;printf("Name: %s\tAge: %d\n",
                                    (ptr+i)->name, (ptr+i)->age);<br>

                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return 0;<br>

                    The insertion into a singly linked list can be performed at different positions. Based on the
                    position of the new node being inserted, the insertion is categorized into the following categories
                    -

                    The Deletion of a node from a singly linked list can be performed at different positions. Based on
