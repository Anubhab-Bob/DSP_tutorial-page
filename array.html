                <h2>Coursework for Arrays</h2><br>

                <br>
                <p>
                    You already know about variables. A variable is a named memory location to store a single value in
                    memory. But many a times, we need a set of values together as a unit. Arrays come handy in such
                    situations.<br>
                    An array is defined as the collection of similar type of data items stored at contiguous memory
                    locations. All arrays consist of contiguous memory locations. The lowest address corresponds to the
                    first element and the highest
                    address to the last element. Arrays are the derived data type in C programming language which can
                    store the primitive type of data such as int, char, double, float, etc. It also has the capability
                    to store the collection of derived data types, such as pointers, structure, etc.<br>
                    As said earlier, array is beneficial if you have to store similar elements. For example, if we want
                    to store the marks of a student in 6 subjects, then we don't need to define different variables for
                    the marks in the different subject. Instead of that, we can define an array which can store the
                    marks in each subject at the contiguous memory locations.<br>

                <ol>
                    <li>1. Each element of an array is of same data type and carries the same size, i.e., int = 4 bytes.
                    </li>
                    <li>2. Elements of the array are stored at contiguous memory locations where the first element is
                        stored at the smallest memory location.</li>
                    <li>3. Elements of the array can be randomly accessed since we can calculate the address of each
                        element of the array with the given base address and the size of the data element.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Declaration and Initialization of Arrays</h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                    To declare an array in C, a programmer specifies the type of the elements and the number of elements
                    required by an array as follows -
                <div class="code">type arrayName [ arraySize ];</div>
                This is called a single-dimensional array. The arraySize must be an integer constant greater than zero
                and type can be any valid C data type. For example, to declare a 10-element array called balance of type
                double, use this statement −
                <div class="code">double balance[10];</div>
                Here balance is a variable array which is sufficient to hold up to 10 double numbers.
                You can initialize an array in C either one by one or using a single statement as follows −
                <div class="code">double balance[5] = {1000.0, 2.0, 3.4, 7.0, 50.0};</div>
                The number of values between braces { } cannot be larger than the number of elements that we declare for
                the array
                between square brackets [ ]. If you omit the size of the array, an array just big enough to hold the
                initialization is created. Therefore, if you write −
                <div class="code">double balance[] = {1000.0, 2.0, 3.4, 7.0, 50.0};</div>
                You will create exactly the same array as you did in the previous example. Following is an example to
                assign a single element of the array −
                <div class="code">balance[4] = 50.0;</div>
                The above statement assigns the 5th element in the array with a value of 50.0. All arrays have 0 as the
                index of their first element which is also called the base index and the last index of an array will be
                total size of the array minus 1. Shown below is the pictorial representation of the array we discussed
                above −
