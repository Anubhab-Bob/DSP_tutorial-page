                <h2>Coursework for Queues</h2>
                <hr>
                <br>
                <p>
                    We have already covered Arrays and Linked Lists in our previous weeks as part of this course. We
                    have also tried to understand what stack data structure is and how to implement it using arrays as
                    well as linked lists last week. This week we shall try to do the same with another data structure
                    known as queues.<br>
                    A Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are
                    performed. The order is First-In-First-Out (FIFO). A good example of a queue is any queue of
                    consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first. <br>
                    The difference between stacks and queues is in removing. In a stack we remove the item the most
                    recently added; in a queue, we remove the item the least recently added.It contains two pointers -
                    front pointer pointing to the first element of the queue and rear pointer pointing to the last
                    element in the queue. Whenever an element is added in the queue, it is added at the end of the
                    queue, and an element can be deleted only from the front of the queue. <br>
                    A real-life example of a stack is shown below.<br>

                <h4>Properties of Queues</h4><br>
                <p>
                    Some key properties related to queue are -
                <ol>
                    <li>1. A queue can be defined as an ordered list which enables insert operations to be performed at
                        one end called REAR and delete operations to be performed at another end called FRONT.</li>
                    <li>2. A Queue is an abstract data type with a pre-defined capacity, which means that it can store
                        the elements of a limited size.</li>
                    <li>3. It is a data structure that follows some order to insert and delete the elements, and that
                        order can be LIFO or FILO. This ordering is maintained by 2 operations - enqueue and dequeue.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                </p>

                <h4>Applications of Queues</h4><br>
                <p>
                    Some key applications related to queue are -
                <ol>
                    <li>1. Queues are widely used as waiting lists for a single shared resource like printer, disk, CPU.
                    </li>
                    <li>2.Queues are used in asynchronous transfer of data. </li>
                    <li>3. Queues are used as buffers in most of the applications like MP3 media player, CD player, etc.
                    </li>
                    <li>4. Queues are used in operating systems for handling interrupts. </li>
                </ol>
                </p>
                <br>

                <h4>Operations on Queues</h4><br>
                <p>
                    There are some basic operations that allow us to perform different actions on a queue.
                <ol>
                    <li>1. <b> Enqueue </b>: Add an element to the end of the queue.</li>
                    <li>2. <b> Dequeue </b>: Remove an element from the front of the queue.</li>
                    <li>3. <b> IsEmpty </b>: Check if the queue is empty.</li>
                    <li>4. <b> IsFull </b>: Check if the queue is full</li>
                    <li>5. <b> Peek </b>: Get the value of the element at the front of the queue without removing it
                    </li>
                </ol>
                </p>
                <br>

                <h4>Working of Queues</h4><br>
                <p>
                    As mentioned earlier, queues work in First-In-First-Out (FIFO) strategy. This strategy is followed
                    by
                    the Enqueue and Dequeue operations. The action performed by these 2 primary operations is shown
                    below -
