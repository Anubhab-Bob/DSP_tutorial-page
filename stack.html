                <hr>
                <br>
                <p>
                    We have already covered Arrays and Linked Lists in our previous weeks as part of this course. In
                    this week we shall try to understand what stack data structure is and how to implement it using
                    arrays as well as linked Lists.<br>
                    A Stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) principle. It contains
                    only one pointer - top pointer pointing to the topmost element of the stack. Whenever an element is
                    added in the stack, it is added on the top of the stack, and an element can be deleted only from the
                    top of the stack. In other words, a stack can be defined as a container in which insertion and
                    deletion can be done from the one end known as the top of the stack. <br>
                    A real-life example of a stack is shown below.<br>

                <h4>Properties of Stacks</h4><br>
                <p>
                    Some key points related to stack are -
                <ol>
                    <li>1. It is called as stack because it behaves like a real-world stack, piles of books, etc.</li>
                    <li>2. A Stack is an abstract data type with a pre-defined capacity, which means that it can store
                        the elements of a limited size.</li>
                    <li>3. It is a data structure that follows some order to insert and delete the elements, and that
                        order can be LIFO or FILO.</li>
                </ol>
                </p>

                <h4>Operations on Stacks</h4><br>
                <p>
                    There are some basic operations that allow us to perform different actions on a stack.
                <ol>
                    <li>1. <b> Push </b>: Add an element to the top of a stack.</li>
                    <li>2. <b> Pop </b>: Remove an element from the top of a stack.</li>
                    <li>3. <b> IsEmpty </b>: Check if the stack is empty.</li>
                    <li>4. <b> IsFull </b>: Check if the stack is full</li>
                    <li>5. <b> Peek </b>: Get the value of the top element without removing it</li>
                </ol>
                </p>
                <br>

                <h4>Working of Stacks</h4><br>
                <p>
                    As mentioned earlier, stacks work in Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) strategy. This strategy is followed by
                    the Push and Pop operations. The action performed by these 2 primary operations is shown below -
